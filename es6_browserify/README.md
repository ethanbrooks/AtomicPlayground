# ES6 / Browserify Example

Using AtomicNewbie's atomify repo (https://github.com/atomicnewbie/atomify-examples) as a basis, added the following

* Added in my additions to allow for requiring npm modules into components (see: https://github.com/shaddockh/atomify-examples )
* Converted all js files to es6 files
* added task to run these through babelJs when building
* added watch tasks to gulp file to rebuild js files as well as vendor.js file
