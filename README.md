# AtomicPlayground
Various experiments with the Atomic Game Engine ( http://www.atomicgameengine.com )

* **es6_browserify** - playing with writing scripts and components in es6 and using babelJs to build
* **simple_blueprint_test** - A very basic example that shows how to define a blueprint for an entity and then construct it, instead of hand constructing and attaching components to an entity.
* **space_shooter_es6_blueprint** - A conversion of the space shooter example to es6 transpiled by BabelJs and modified to use the blueprint system for entities.
* **rot_tests** - A collection of different scenarios using the ROguelike Toolkit (http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) with the Atomic Engine (very much WIP!)
