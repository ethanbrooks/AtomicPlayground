# AtomicPlayground
Various experiments with the Atomic Game Engine ( http://www.atomicgameengine.com )

* **es6_browserify** - playing with writing scripts and components in es6 and using babelJs to build
* **simple_blueprint_test** - A very basic example that shows how to define a blueprint for an entity and then construct it, instead of hand contructing and attaching components to an entity.
