# Atomic Utilities

A collection of useful routines to use in Atomic Game Engine projects.
(Work in Progress)

This is being written in typescript and as of Typescript 1.6, Typescript will be able to pull in the `d.ts` file properly.


## Usage

```javascript
var atomicUtils = require('atomic-utils');
```

Typescript
```javascript
import * as atomicUtils from 'atomic-utils';
```


See the [Typescript Project Seed](../tsc_project_seed/README) project for usage and how to use this in Atomic Game Engine projects via bundling with Browserify.
