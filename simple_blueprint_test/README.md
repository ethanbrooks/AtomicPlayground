This is an example project using the [Atomic Blueprint Library](https://github.com/shaddockh/AtomicPlayground/tree/master/atomic-blueprintlib)

More information about blueprints can be found in the **atomic-blueprintlib** documentation.

Some things to note about this project:

Take a look at the following files for how they are configured
* Modules/blueprints.js - this is where all the blueprints reside
* main.js - this instantiates two different star blueprints that descend from a base star
* Components/Star.js - a very simple blueprint aware component
